Progress:-
1. Arrays -
            Array is collection similar data type stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a linear data structure. It is a static data structure with a fixed size.
            Operations :-
                1. Traversal - Visiting each element of an array in a specific order [sequential or reversal].
                2. Insertion - Adding new element to an array at a specific index.
                3. Deletion - Removing an existing element from an array at a specific index.
                4. Searching - Finding the index of an element in an array.
                5. Retrieval - Returning an element present at a specific index from an array.
            Advantages :-
                1. Retrieval of an element is faster.
                2. Requires less memory compared with linked list.
            DisAdvantages :-
                1. Adding new element is slow.
                2. Deleting existing element is slow.
                3. When array is initialized memory gets reserved even if element is not added.
