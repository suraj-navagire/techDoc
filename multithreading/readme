Multithreading topic is covered by udemy course.

Thread is the smallest light weight process.

Life cycle :
1. New state - When we create thread. Thread t = new Thread().
2. Runnable / Running - When we start thread it goes in runnable state then depending upon availability it goes to running state
    t.start.
3. Blocked state - When thread tries to acquire lock but not available. synchronized(Object) {}.
4. Waiting state - When thread is waiting for notification. object.wait().
5. Timed waiting state - When thread is waiting for definite amount of time. object.wait(1000).
6. Terminate state - When thread completes its task or any exception occured.


2 ways to create threads :-
	1. extends Thread class -
		Starting thread - NewThreadClass t1 = new NewThreadClass();
							t1.start();
		Example :- org.example.ThreadCreationExample1

	2. Implement Runnable interface -
		starting thread - Thread t = new Thread(new NewRunnableThread);
							t.start()
        Example :- org.example.ThreadCreationExample2

Thread vs Runnable :-
    - Thread represents actual thread which runs and it has all the methods supported by threads. Runnable on other hand represents task.
    - When we use threads we cannot differentiate tasks , we have to tasks within thread only, this might affect quality of code and usability. With runnable we can separate
     out task from Thread.
    - Resource sharing between multiple threads become easies with runnable.
    - If you want to enhance Thread or override ny property of method that time we should think of using extending threads otherwise use runnable.

Join :-
    thread.join() method will tell currently executing thread to wait for this thread (thread on which join method is called) to finish its job.
    Example :- org.example.JoinExample

Volatile keyword :-
    Volatile means read from main memory not from CPU registers since in multicore system each cpu has its own register to store data.

	Sometimes on some systems it might happen that some shared data or data which is going to be updated by another thread is cached by running thread and never check for
	updated value. Or Code might interpreted in such a way that system might feel that data which is shared or getting updated by another thread is useless and because of
	this system might never check its updated value . In such case we should use volatile keyword on those shared data. It can happen on some systems, its not always true
	for all systems.
    Example :- org.example.VolatileExample

synchronized keyword on method :-
	Every object in java has intrinsic lock. At a time only one thread can acquire this lock. When we mark any method synchronized then thread has to aquire this intrensic lock inorder do any processing on tht object.

	When we use synchronized keyword on method then we don't need to use volatile keyword for shared data, by default that shared data is monitored by all the threads

	Case : If class has 2 synchronized methods and if 2 threads want to access them then at a time only 1 thread can access one of the thread. If 1 thread is accessing one method then other thread cannont access same or other synchrozed method.

	void synchronized method1(){
		//do stuff
	}

	void synchronized method2(){
		//do stuff
	}

	Solution : To solve this we can use synchronized lock on separate objects.

	Object o1 = new Object();
	Object o2 = new Object();

	void method1(){
		synchronized(o1){
			//do stuff
		]
	}

	void method2(){
		synchronized(o2){
			//do stuff
		]
	}

Executor Framework :-
    It is created to use existing threads rather than creating new threads every time. It works on concept of thread pooling. It uses
    existing thread from thread pool to execute task.

    Executor and ExecutorService are interface.
    Executors is class which provide factory methods to create thread pools.
    4 Types of ExecutorService are available
        - SingleThreadPool : Thread poo with single thread.
        - FixedThreadPool : Thread pool with fixed number of threads
        - CachedThreadPool : Creates thread pool which creates new thread if require else will use existing one. If no thread is available
                in thread pool then it creates new one.
        - ScheduledExecutor : We can use this when task needs to be run at a regular interval or if we want to delay a task.

    Example :- src/main/java/org/example/threadpool

    Future object :- We can access result of a task submitted to executor using Future<> object. If we want result the we should
    implement Callable interface instead of Runnable for task.

    Example : org.example.threadpool.FuturesExample

    shutdown method in ExecutorService : If we don't call it then executors keeps running in background. Once we call this executor will
        not accept new tasks and shuts down.

    awaitTermination : Program waits at this for given amount of time or all tasks gets completed.  When time gets completed program
        resumes from this point but in background executors stays alive. so to kill or shut down executor threads we need to call
        shutdown method.

    Example : org.example.threadpool.AwaitTerminationExample

CountDown latch :-
     It helps if any thread wants to wait for other n number of threads to complete its tasks. When we create countDown latch we
     provide number then we pass this latch object to all those threads on which we are dependent. Then once thread completes their
     tasks it decrements count by 1. Like this all threads decrements latch by 1 one. When latch reaches to zero thread which is waiting
     resumes and starts running.

     Example : org.example.CountDownLatchExample

 Producer Consumer problem :-
    Producer consumer problem is best solved by using blocking queue.

    Wait and Notify: When we call wait method on an object on which we are want to wait to notify it then current thread goes to wait state.
        Then another thread which is waiting for intrinsic lock of that object gets lock and enters synchronized block.
        When this thread call notify method on object who's intrinsic lock is getting used then other thread which is in wait state gets notification
        and that starts starts running once that other thread exits synchronized block.
        When we use wait notify we are actually using resources efficiently otherwise ew can achieve same using synchronization also but
        that time we will end-up tracking some flag in loop which will use cpu resource unnecessary.

    Example : org.example.producerconsumer.ProducerConsumerUsingQueue

 Re-entrant Lock :- It's used when we don't want to use synchronized method or block where we try to get intrinsic lock of provided object,
    but still we want to achieve synchronization.

    lock : When we call this method only one thread can get lock other threads goes in waiting state.
    unlock : When we call this method current thread releases lock and other threads which are waiting for lock one of them gets lock.
    await : Used like wait method
    signal : Used like notify method
    tryLock : Same as lock method only difference is if acquires lick then returns true else false.

    Example : org/example/locks

 DeadLock : Deadlock occurs when onc Thread has acquired lock on one resource and waiting for lock on another resource but at same time another
    thread have acquired lock on another resource for which first thread is waiting and this second thread also want lock on resource who's lock is
    taken by first resource.

 Semaphore : Semaphore is used to acquire permit. The number provided to semaphore that many number of threads can
    acquire permit and proceed further. If there is no available permit then threads will wait.

    acquire : Used to acquire permit. If permit not available then thread will wait
    release : Used to release permit. Then available permit count increases.
    availablePermit : Used to check available permit count.

    Example : org/example/semaphore

 Interrupt : This method will invoke interrupted exception if thread calling thread is in sleep. If calling thread is running then
    it will update interrupt flag of that thread.

    Example : org.example.InterruptExample
