This project is created to provide understanding of design patterns.

Before design pattern lets understand some basic concepts:-
    1. Inheritance (is a) :- Inheritance shows parent child relationship also known as 'is a' relationship.
        Example :- Dog is a Animal
    2. Association (Has a) :- Association is known as 'has a' relationship. When a class contains instance of some other class then it
        is known as association.
        It has 2 types :
            1. Aggregation : Aggregation is a weak association. Inner object can exists independently even if outer object gets destroyed.
                Example : Library and Book. Library has many books. If we destroy library object even then book can exist somewhere else.
            2. Composition : Composition is a strong association. Inner object cannot exist independently without outer object.
                The life time of contained object is bound to life time of container object.
                Example : Car and Engine. Engine cannot exist without car object. So once car object gets destroyed then engine will also
                    get destroyed.

What is design pattern:-
    Design pattern is a solution to commonly occurring problems in a software design. They are like pre made blue print which
    you can customize to solve design problems in your code.

SOLID principle in software design:- These are the design principles that needs to be consider while designing the software
SOLID (with real examples)

    SRP: separating business logic vs orchestration

    OCP: adding features without modifying existing code

    LSP: correct inheritance usage

    ISP: avoiding fat interfaces

    DIP: programming to abstractions

1. Single responsibility principle -
        A class should have only one reason to change. i.e. A class should have only one job to do or one task or one purpose.
        Example :- com.patterns.solid.SingleResponsibilityViolation,
                    com.patterns.solid.SingleResponsibilityCorrect

2. Open/Closed principle -
        A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. Suppose if you have PaymentProcessor which contains
        code to process payment of credit card. In future if we want to add phonepe payment then if we add that code in same class
        then it is violation of open/closed principle. Instead we should write a parent interface PaymentProcessor and implement this
        using new new payment processor's. In this way its easy to add new payment methods without changing existing classes.
        Example :- com.patterns.solid.OpenClosedViolation,
                    com.patterns.solid.OpenClosedCorrect

3. Liskov substitution principle -
        It states that object of superclass can be replaced by object of sub class without affecting correctness of a program.

        Example :com.patterns.solid.LiskovSubstitutionShapeCorrect, com.patterns.solid.LiskovSubstitutionShapeViolation
        Case 1 : Suppose we have Rectangle class with width and height variable and setter methods.
                 It has area() method to return area of rectangle (width * height).
                Now consider we have Square class which is a rectangle, So we will end up extending rectangle for Square class to reuse area() method and setter methods.
                For rectangle width and height are independent. But for square its dependent. So exposing separate setter for width and height for Square class is not right.

        Problem/Violation : “Square violates Liskov Substitution Principle because it changes the behavior of Rectangle’s setters.
                            Rectangle assumes width and height are independent, but Square makes them dependent.
                            So when a Square is substituted for a Rectangle, client expectations break.”

        Fix/Solution : Redesign this and use correct approach to avoid inheritance and use a common abstraction like Shape.


        Also If parent class has method which child class cannot use or override then LSP is broken.

        Example :
        Case 2 : Suppose we have Bird interface with methods eat and fly. So whoever will implement Bird they will have to implement both methods.
        Suppose we have Sparrow and Penguin Classes, as we know both are Bird's then we will end up implementing Bird interface for both the classes.
        Then they will have to override both methods.

        Problem/Violation : The LSP violation occurs because the Bird interface forces all birds to implement fly().
                            Penguin cannot fly, so it throws an exception, which breaks the contract.
                            When the client substitutes a Sparrow with a Penguin, behavior changes, violating LSP.

        Fix/Solution : The fix is we have to redesign interfaces to separate behavior into smaller interfaces like Flyable.
    
        Example :- com.patterns.solid.LiskovSubstitutionBirdViolation, com.patterns.solid.LiskovSubstitutionBirdCorrect


4. Interface segregation principle -
        This principle states that interface should be segregated properly. This principle is similar to single responsibility principle.
        One interface should not contain all the method just for the sake of having. It should have only required and relevant methods.
        Methods should be segregated in multiple interfaces as per requirement.
        Example :- com.patterns.solid.InterfaceSegregationViolation,
                    com.patterns.solid.InterfaceSegregationCorrect

5. Dependency Inversion Principle -
        It states that high level module should not depend on low level module, Both should depend on abstraction.
        Example :- com.patterns.solid.DependencyInversionViolation,
                    com.patterns.solid.DependencyInversionCorrect

--------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 categories of design patterns:-

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-design-patterns-example-tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ff_KZdvJn8

1. Creational design pattern -
        Creational design pattern gives us best possible way to instantiate an object in a specific situation.

        1. Singleton design pattern :- Singleton design pattern restricts instantiation of an object. It allows only one instance of a class
            inside a java virtual machine.
            Example :- com.patterns.creational.singleton.EagerInitialization,
                        com.patterns.creational.singleton.EagerInitializationIssueExample,
                        com.patterns.creational.singleton.StaticBlockInitialization,
                        com.patterns.creational.singleton.LazyInitialization,
                        com.patterns.creational.singleton.ThreadSafeInitialization,
                        com.patterns.creational.singleton.StaticInnerClassInitialization

            Reflection, Deserialization and cloning are 3 ways to broke singleton.

            Reflection :- In reflection we can make constructor accessible by making it's visibility true.
                          To overcome reflection issue we can use Enum or we can throw Exception from constructor if instance variable is not null.

            Deserialization :- When we do deserialization of serialized object it creates new object.
                            To overcome this issue we can use "readResolve" method.

            Cloning :- In cloning we can create clone of a object using clone method.
                        We can overcome this using overriding clone method and throwing "clone not supported Exception".

            Example :- com.patterns.creational.singleton.FinalSingleton

        2. Factory pattern (Factory method):- When we have a situation where we have super class and multiple subclasses and base on input we have to return
            one of the subclass. This pattern takes out responsibility of instantiation of subclasses from clients code to factory class.
            We can use singleton pattern on factory class or make the factory method static.

            Example :- com.patterns.creational.factoryPattern.ComputerTest

        3. Abstract Factory :- It add another layer on top of factory pattern. Abstract factory return factory class, This returned factory class will return
            desired object.

            Example :-  com.patterns.creational.abstractFactory.ShapeTest,
                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hXZnI86E2Y

        4. Builder design pattern :- Builder design pattern helps in creation of complex objects
            Builder design patter should be used in following scenario :-
                1. When we want to create complex objects like large number of constructor parameters,
                    Possibilities of having new properties or attributes in future, Not All constructor
                    arguments are mandatory.
                2. When we want object similar like immutable.

            Example :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ff_KZdvJn8,
                        com.patterns.creational.builder.URLWithBuilder

        5. Prototype design pattern :- If we have a design requirement where we have to create copies of objects of a class
            then we can use prototype design pattern. If we don't then we will have to write so much redundant code to make copy of
            objects.
            Implement cloneable interface where we have to achieve prototype pattern. Classes which implements cloneable are known as prototypes.
            Cloning is nothing but copying. There are 2 types of copy. Shallow and deep.

            Shallow copy :- If we implement Cloneable interface and override Clone method then default implementation will give shallow copy feature.
                Example :- com.patterns.creational.prototype.CompanyShallowExample
            Deep copy :- If we implement Cloneable interface and override Clone method then Along with default implementation clone all non primitive
                        and non immutable fields explicitly.
                Example :- com.patterns.creational.prototype.CompanyDeepExample

            We can create copy using copy constructors as well. This is more advantageous then implementing cloneable.

            Following is the most useful example of prototype
            Example :- com.patterns.creational.prototype.copyConstructor.PrototypeTest

2. Structural design pattern :-
        Structural design pattern provides different ways to create a class structure ( For example using inheritance and composition to create large objects from small small
        objects)

        1. Adapter design pattern :-  Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with different interfaces to collaborate.
            This is use useful when we want to reuse the existing classes without modifying their code, but their interface doesn't match with the requirements of client.
            It extends the target interface and creates association with adaptee interface. Target interface is the one which is dealing with client.

            Example : com.patterns.structural.adapter.Client

        2. Bridge design pattern :- It is used to decouple abstraction from implementation. i.e. You are removing some of the functionality from existing abstract class,
            creating new interface for that functionality. Creating new implementation classes and adding that functionality to it. Then add this new interface inside abstract class
            and provide its instance at run time to constructor of abstract class.

            Problem solved by bridge :
            1. Suppose if have a requirement to make a system to draw different shapes. What you will do. You will make shape interface. Then you will add its implementations.
            consider initially you have created 2 shapes Triangle and Square.
            2. Now consider in future client wants red color and blue colored shapes. Then what you will do, in order to reuse the shape making code you will create new class
            which will extend the existing shapes i.e. You will make RedTriangleShape which will extend TriangleShape,  BlueTriangleShape which will extend TriangleShape,
            RedSquareShape which will extend SquareShape, BlueSquareShape which will extend SquareShape.
            3. Till now you will feel like you have designed great system but wait what if in future client will add more shape and more colors.
                consider even if client demands 2 more shape and 2 more colors then you will end up having
                total shapes = 4
                total colors = 4
                Total colored shape classes = 16 i.e. cartesian product.
            Then you will realize how messy system.

            Example : com.patterns.structural.bridge.problem.Client

            Solution :
            1. First understand the problem.
            2. Here drawing shape and coloring it are 2 different tasks. This we can decouple.
            3. Create Color interface and create its implementations.
            4. Use association over inheritance i.e. add color object inside shape.
            5. Make shape as abstract class so that it can contain Color, and write its implementations.
            6. Pass color object at the time of creating shape
            7. Here if you want to add more 2 color then you will have to create only 2 color classes not more. You can pass color object to shape at the time of creation
            If you want to add more 2 shapes then also you will have to create only 2 classes.

            Elements of Bridge design patterns :
                1. Implementor - Functionality which we are separating out/decoupling. Here Color is the implementor
                2. Concrete implementation - Concrete classes which implements implementor. Here RedColor and BlueColor
                3. Abstraction - Core of the bridge design pattern. It holds the instance of implementor. It provides abstract method
                which is used by client. Here 'Shape' class. 'draw()' is the method which is providing abstraction to client.
                Also Shape class delegate draw() call to color object.
                4. Concrete abstraction - Concrete classes which extends abstract class. It uses concrete implementor objects to do work.
                Here it uses RedColor or BlueColor to fill color.

            Example : com.patterns.structural.bridge.solution.Client

        3. Composite Design Pattern -
            It helps you to compose objects into tree like structure to represent part-whole hierarchy. With the help of this design you can
            interact with object uniformly as it implements same interface.

            Part-whole hierarchy is not but there is a object which is container and it contains all the parts.

            Key concept :
                1. Component (Interface) : It is an interface which contains operation implemented by leaf of composite.
                2. Leaf : It is an individual object with no children.
                3. Composite (Container) : This object contains one or more children (can be leaf or other composite)
                4. Client : It interact with component to perform operation.

            Each part of the composite structure is able to provide its result independently is the key advantage

            Example : We can create file system using composite design pattern. Where we can have files and directory
                Both os them can implement common interface FileSystem which can have getSize(). Each file is associated with some size.
                Directory contains another directories of files. So Directory is composite and File is leaf.

                Using this patterns any directory can tell us its size by delegating its call to getSize() method.

                Client will interact with component operation i.e. getSize();

                Example : com.patterns.structural.composite.Client

        4. Decorator Design pattern -
            When you want to add new behavior or responsibilities to an existing object then you can use this. This pattern provides flexible alternative to
            subclassing where you want to extend objects functionality.
            You can decorate an object by wrapping it with another object that adds extra functionality to it without changing original class.

            Key concepts :
                1. Component Interface :- Interface to declare core functionality. (Coffee)
                2. Concrete Component class :- Class which provides basic core functionality. (SimpleCoffee)
                3. abstract decorator class :- Abstract decorator class which implements component and contains base component instance. (CoffeeDecorator)
                4. Concrete decorator class :- Concrete decorator class which provides additional functionalities. (MilkDecorator, SugarDecorator)

            This design pattern avoid multi-level inheritance. Without decorator coffee system would have looked like Following :-
            SugarCoffee extending MikCoffee extending SimpleCoffee and so on..

            To avoid this we should use decorator . Now you can add any new behaviour and use existing without modifying it.
            You can add HoneyClass just by extending abstract decorator.

            Example : com.patterns.structural.decorator.Client

            Note : Design wise bridge and decorator may look same but bridge does not solve same purpose. Shape and color is different.
            In decorator purpose is same i.e. getPrice and prepare. In decorator there is one base and around that we decorate. Like simpleCoffee
            then we add sugar and mil etc.

        5. Facade Design pattern -
            It helps in restructuring the code. If you feel that you have a complex system and you have exposed too many functions or API to
            client then you can add facade layer to it. Facade is just another layer with simplified/minimum number of API/functions. Facade takes
            care of calling required functions/API's/subsystems on behalf of client.

            In simple words if you have end-up exposing number of API's to do a task, then Facade groups those tasks in single/more
            (based on requirement) API and client can use this new facade API and then facade internally will call number of API's.
                        ✔ Facade simplifies a complex system
                        ✔ It exposes fewer, cleaner APIs to the client
                        ✔ It calls multiple subsystems on behalf of the client
                        ✔ Client should not know internal complexity
                        ✔ Facade is an orchestration layer

            Example : com.patterns.structural.facade.problem.Client
                com.patterns.structural.facade.solution.Client

        6. Flyweight Design pattern -
            - It is used to save memory and improve performance by sharing as much data as possible among same type of objects.
            - It is used in a system where large number of objects gets created with some common properties.
            - Objects' data can be divided into 2 types :
                1. Intrinsic data - This data is common between multiple objects and it is not going to get changed at run time. Immutable part of object.
                2. Extrinsic data - This data is specific to every object and which cannot be shared.

            Steps to use flyweight design pattern :
                1. Find out intrinsic and extrinsic data of a class. (Tree)
                2. Pull out intrinsic data from class and create new flyweight class which will store this intrinsic data. (TreeType)
                3. Create flyweight class with intrinsic data and add same operation by passing extrinsic data to it. display(positionX, positionY).
                4. Add this newly created flyweight class instance inside original class.
                5. Now original class method won't do operation instead it will delegate task to flyweight class by passing extrinsic data.
                6. Create flyweight factory. This will contain cache. This factory will return flyweight object from cache. i.e. flyweight object will
                get created once for each key. (TreeTypeFactory)
                7. Client will create original class instance by passing flyweight object to it from factory.

                Example : com.patterns.structural.flyweight.problem.Client
                com.patterns.structural.flyweight.solution.Client

        7. Proxy Design pattern -
            - In proxy design pattern we provide object (UserServiceProxy) which controls access of another object (UserService).
            - The purpose of Proxy is to control access to an object. As part of that control, it can add cross-cutting concerns
              like caching, logging, security, or lazy initialization.

              Difference in Proxy and facade is -> Proxy controls access of single object. Facade is used to control multiple subsystem.

            Example : com.patterns.structural.proxy.Client


3. Behavioral Design Pattern -
    It focuses on object interactions. It shows how object should interact with each other efficiently and flexibly. It promotes loose coupling.

    1. Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern -
        - It is used when we have multiple handlers which process request sequentially. Each handler can either process the request or it can
        pass it to the next handler.
        - We can implement this using 1 abstract handler class which will contain abstract method handle(request). It will also contain
        reference to nextHandler. It will contain setHandler(handler) method to set next handler.
        - Each handler will extend this abstract class and call  next handler if present else it will return the result.

        Example : com.patterns.behavioral.chainOfResponsibility.Client

    2. Command Design Pattern -
        - This design pattern allows actions as an object to decouple the request operation. Generally we make action/operation as methods and call them.
          But in this pattern we make action/operation as object and pass it to invoker.
        - Consider Bulb as a receiver which has 2 operation turn on , turn off. Then We can make 2 Command classes for it.
        - These commands knows how to perform that action.
        - Client will only need to use this wil remote control.

        - Components :
            1. Receiver - The object which will be controlled by commands. (Bulb)
            2. Command Interface - It defines execute() and undo() method. (Command)
            3. Concrete command - It implements Command interface. It contains the receiver object. (TurnOn, TurnOff)
            4. Invoker - Stores the commands executes/undoes it. (RemoteControl)
            5. Client - Creates command and executes it with the help of Invoker.

            Example : com.patterns.behavioral.command.Bulb

    3. Iterator Design pattern -
        - It provides a way to access elements of a collection (array, tree, list) sequentially  without exposing their underlying structure.

        - Components :
            1. Iterator interface : It provides methods to access elements sequentially
            2. Concrete Iterator  : It implements iterator interface and provides way to access elements sequentially.
            3. Iterable interface : Collection which we don't want to expose will implement this interface. It returns concrete iterator.
            4. Concrete iterable : It returns iterator.

        Example : com.patterns.behavioral.iterator.Client

    4. Mediator Design pattern -
        - It introduces mediator so that different objects can talk to each other without direct dependency i.e. objects will not communicate
        directly instead they will use mediator.
        - It helps loose coupling.
        - Objects are not tightly coupled with each other.
        - Just like airplanes communicate with each other through air traffic control tower(mediator).

        Example : com.patterns.behavioral.mediator.ChatRoomSimulator

    5. Observer Design pattern -
        - Suppose there are 2 screen which are showing current temperature if temperature is updated this screen should also show updated value.
        To achieve this screen's has to check status of weather station time to time. But its not good solution. Instead if weather station gets updated
        then it should update every screen about it's change. This problem is solved by observer design pattern.
        - In this pattern subject i.e. weather station keeps list of observer's i.e. screens and update them once temperature gets updated.
        - In this pattern when the subject (observable) changes state, all its observer's(listeners) gets notified and updated automatically.
        - Components :
            1. Subject - It is observable which is being observed by observer's. Maintains list of observer's.
            2. Observers - Updates itself when notified by subject.

    6. Memento Design pattern -
        - It is used to capture object's state and restore later.
        - It is used to implement features like undo/redo, snapshots, history-tracking etc.
        - It is used when direct access to an object's state is not allowed due to encapsulation.
        - In notepad memento example we are creating new memento with current state of notepad. This memento we are passing to caretaker.
          Caretaker keeps history of memento's. On undo caretaker pop's memento from history and uses it for undo operation.
        - Components :
            1. Originator : The object whose state needs to be saved and restore later. [Notepad]
            2. Memento : It stores originator's state. [NotepadMemento]
            3. Caretaker : Keeps track of mementos but do not modify them. It can restore originator using memento. [NotepadCaretaker]

    7. State Design pattern -
        - It allows object to change its behavior based on change in its state.
        - It is used when objects behavior depends on its state and needs to change as its state changes.
        - Basically in this design pattern we are delegating object's responsibility to each state. How object will behave on some action
        will be determined by its state. So each state will have all the methods as the main object.
        - Consider coffee machine. It can have 3 states. Idle, Selection, dispense state.
        - It can have 3 actions (3 buttons) insertCoin, selectCoffee, dispense.
        - Coffee machine behavior depends on current state. Foe Example if state is idle you cannot directly select coffee, first you
        will have to insert coin. Once you are in selection state again you cannot insert coin and so on.
        - So each state will contain all these 3 methods (insertCoin, selectCoffee, dispense) and they will provide respective implementation
        accordingly

        Example : com.patterns.behavioral.state.Client

    8. Strategy Design pattern -
        - It is used when you have multiple algorithms (strategies) that can used interchangeably.
        - When you want to avoid lot of if-else in code.
        - It promotes open-closed principle.
        - When you don't want to tightly couple the implementation. When implementation will be available at run time.
        - There can be multiple payment methods. Credit card, upi, debit card etc. Also new payment method can be introduced in future.
        Hence we need to design a code in such a way that we can achieve this. This can be achieved using strategy.
        - Need to create 1 strategy interface. Implement this interface for new payment methods like credit card, debit card etc.
        - Need to create class which will hold strategy interface. This class will use that interface for payment. At run time based on user's
          choice payment method object will be injected in that strategy interface

        Example : com.patterns.behavioral.strategy.Client

    9. Visitor Design pattern -
        - It is used when we want to keep algorithm (behavior) separate from object.
        - Also when you want to perform operation on set of objects without modifying them.
        - Also new behavior can be added without changing object.
        - In this individual element is responsible for calling respective visitor method.
        - If new behaviors are frequently added then this is useful.
        - If new elements are frequently added then this is not useful as adding new element means changing visitor by adding new visit(newElement) method.
           This is costly since all the existing behaviors will need to update. This will violet open-closed principle.
        - Suppose we are having system where we are going to work on 2 shapes. Triangle and square. If we sure that no new shape will be added
        in system but operation on these shapes will get added then we can use visitor.
        - Component :
            1. Visitor interface : Defines operations to be performed on different object types. (ShapeVisitor)
            2. Concrete visitor : It implements visitor. (DrawShape)
            3. Element : Interface for object. It defines void accept(Visitor) method.  (Shape)
            4. Concrete element : It implements Element interface. (Triangle, Square)

            Example : com.patterns.behavioral.visitor.Client

    10. Template Method Design pattern -
        - It defines skeleton of an algorithm in superclass and allows subclasses to override specific steps.
        - Servlet in webserver is good example of this. We have created one abstract servlet which has service method (Template method).
        This method will act as template method, determines how each request should be processed. This template method calls doGet, doPost
        methods depending on some conditions. This class also provides default implementation for doGet and doPost. but its client responsibility
        to provide correct implementation.
        - In normal term you can say that in template method design pattern we provide one method which calls other methods based on requirement
        and implementation of those other methods will be given by client i.e subclass.
        - It follows open-closed principle.
        - Client can add new new servlet to handle doGet and doPost.

        Example : com.patterns.behavioral.templateMethod.Application

    11. Interpreter Design pattern -
        - It is used to define grammar for a language and provides interpreter to evaluate expression in that language.
        - Like SQL query parsing, compiler etc.
