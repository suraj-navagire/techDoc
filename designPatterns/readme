This project is created to provide understanding of design patterns.

What is design pattern:-
    Design pattern is a solution to commonly occurring problems in a software design. They are like pre made blue print which
    you can customize to solve design problems in your code.

SOLID principle in software design:-
1. Single responsibility principle -
        A class should have only one reason to change. i.e. A class should have only one job to do or one task or one purpose.

2. Open/Closed principle -
        A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Liskov substitution principle -
        It states that object of superclass can be replaced by object of sub class without affecting correctness of a program.
        Example :-

There are 3 categories or design pattern:-
1. Creational design pattern
2. Structural design pattern
3. Behavioral design pattern
