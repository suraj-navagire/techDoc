Git work flow : 

When we create files it is considered as untracked files -> When we add this file using git add cmd then it considered as uncommitted files
->When we commit the file it gets commited in local repository -> when we push file then it goes in remote repository

cmd to downloan github repository:-
git clone {copy from git hub under ssh tab}

Useful cmds :
1. "git init" this cmd is used to initialize Git repository . Go inside your project directory and fire this cmd. "git init" it will 
   create empty repository

2. "git status" this cmd will show on which branch you are currently and will show all untracked files and files wich are yet to commit.

3. "git add {file_name}" this cmd will add file to staging area i.e files which gets tracked by git for any changes. This file will
   be uncommited at this time.

4. "git commit -m "{commmit msg}"" this cmd will commit files to local reposotory with commit msg.

5. "git log" this cmd will display all the latest commits

6. "git revert -n {commit id}" this cmnd will help you to revert your commit based on commit id that we can get using "git status" cmd. 
   Suppose you have commited something at 10 and you again commit something at 12. After some time you realize that you want to revert your 
   commit which you commited at 12. Now get commit id which is done on 12. use "git revert -n". -n cmd will help you to not commit revert 
   changes directly. This cmd will revert all changes of that commit and update files to previous commit. Now if we dont use -n in this cmd
   then "git revert" will directly commit all this reverted changes. But when we use -n it will just update files to its previous commit 
   and will not commit that updated files directly. After this cmd veify changes in files and commit those files sepertly using commit cmd.
  
7. "git reset {commit id} --hard" this cmd will help you to reset changes to that provided commit id.  Suppose you have commited 
   something at 10 and you again commit something at 12 and you agin commit something at 3. After some time you realize that you want 
   to dicard all your changes and go back to the commit 10. You want to discard all commits after 10. Then use this cmd and provide
   commit id of 10.

8. "git branch {branch name}" this cmd will help to create new branch.

9. "git branch" this will list all branch.

10. "git checkout {branch name}" this will help to switch to branch.

11. "git merge {branch name}" this will help to merge the given branch to current branch. First go on master branch. Then use this cmd. 
    All changes from that branch will come on master branch

12 "git remote" will display remote repositories.

13. "git push origin master" this will push master branch to origin repo.

13. "git push --all origin" this will push all branch on origin

14. "git stash save" this cmd will be used when remote branch has some updated commit which is not in out local. 
     When we do git pull and if we get error that stash the changes then use this comn. This cmd will saves the changes from last pull 
    to current time. and revert files to last pull state. After this we can do pull. Now after pull use "git stash pop" to apply your
     changes and resolve conflicts and commit to local and push to remote.

15. "git stash pop" Used to apply changes that we have stashed.

16. "git remote -v" To check current origin url

17. "git remote set-url origin git@github-obdx:your-org/your-repo.git" To change current origin url. This will be useful when we are using mutiple ssh keys and if host is changed in config file.

18. In case of multiple ssh keys use config file in same folder as public private key.
	Content of config file :
	Host work-git
    HostName alm.org.com
    User username@org.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa2
    IdentitiesOnly yes

19. "git clone ssh://work-git/repositioryname.git" Clone cmd in case of multiple ssh keys. Please note "work-git" name should match "Host" of config file.

20. "git checkout -b feature/JiraId-GitIgnore_File" This will create new branch and switch it to new branch.

21. "git push origin feature/JiraId-GitIgnore_File" This will push entire feature branch to origin i.e. to mapped repository. In case config file is updated then follow point 16 and 17.

22. "git checkout develop" Switch to develop branch. As code is merged to develop branch. 

23. "git branch -D feature/JiraId-GitIgnore_File" Delete branch. Before this move to another branch.

24. "git fetch --prune" Fetch updates from remote and remove any remote-tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote.

25. "git pull origin develop" fetches updates from develop branch or ( we can use main if main is the branch where code is merged)

Terms : 
1. "origin" - This is short form for repository which is mapped.
2. "HEAD" - This will help us to use instead of actual commit id. This will point to latest commit id of current branch.
3. "HEAD~1" - This will point to latest minus 1 i.e. second latest commit id.
4. ".gitignore" This file will contains file names which we want to ignore from staging area. Also result in not comes for commit.
		We can use this to add class files and cred files that we should not commit.


Best practice for daily work :

1. git checkout develop => Always go to your main/develop branch before starting new work
2. git pull origin develop => Fetch all updates for develop/main branch from original repository
3. git checkout -b feature/JiraId-GitIgnore_File => This will create new branch and switch it to new branch.
4. git push origin feature/JiraId-GitIgnore_File => This will push entire feature branch to origin i.e. to mapped repository
5. Raise MR to merge feature branch to develop/main branch.
6. Once approved merger the MR from UI
7. Once merged, delete the feature branch
8. git checkout develop => Switch to develop branch. As code is merged to develop branch. 
9. git branch -D feature/JiraId-GitIgnore_File =>  Delete branch locally. Before this move to another branch.
10. git fetch --prune => Fetch updates from remote and remove any remote-tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote.
11. git pull origin develop => fetches updates from develop branch. Check updates.
