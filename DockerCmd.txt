Docker : In docker different conainers have different file systems, they dont share data. It is isolated from each other.

To create docker container and start at the same time:
docker run hello-world
Note : run cmnd will print output of docker in current terminal

List all running containers:
doceker ps 

List all docker containers:
docker ps -a

Create docker contaienr from image:
docker create hello-world

To start docekr using container id:
docker start -a {container_id}
Note : -a is used to attach current terminal with docker and it used to print output of the running container in current cmd line terminal.

To remove stopped container:
docker system prune

To see logs emmited by coontainer:
docker logs {container_id}

Used to stop container:
docker stop {container_id}
Note : It gives 10 sec time to container to shutdown else it internally calls kill cmd.

Used to immediately stop container:
docker kill {container_id}

Pass cmd to docker:
docker run busybox echo hi there
Note : Override cmd is something which will run inside docker. In this case echo cmnd will run inside docker.

To execute cmd in running container:
docker exec -it {contsainer_id} {cmd}
Note : exec is used to pass cmnd. -it is used to provide input to cmd.
-it -> -i and -t. -i indicates that current terminal will be used as std input to the cmd passed with exec. -t used for formatting.

Start shell of running conainer:
docker exec -it {container_id} sh

run container and start shell:
docker run -it {image_name} sh

Suppose if we have db docker and tomcat docker running on same server and if we want to connect tomcat with that db.
Then we should not use localhost as url. Instead use db docker name. To access docker by its name we have to run both docker on same network.

docker network create my-network

docker run -d --name my-db --network my-network -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb postgres:13
  
docker run -d --name my-tomcat --network my-network -p 8080:8080 my-tomcat-image

To list existing docker network
docker network ls

Steps to copy docker image from one server to anothe:-
1. Copy docker image to tar file:
	docker save -o /scratch/obdxdev/kafka/obdxkafka-3.4.0.tar obdxkafka-3.4.0
	scp obdxkafka-3.4.0.tar obdxdev@10.180.57.124:/scratch/obdxdev/kafka
	docker load -i /scratch/obdxdev/kafka/obdxkafka-3.4.0.tar
	docker run -it obdxkafka-3.4.0 /bin/bash
	docker start {container id}
